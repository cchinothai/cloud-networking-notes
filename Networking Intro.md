## I'm starting the AWS Networking Series!

## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about networking within an AWS environment. By the end of the 9 project sections, I will have demonstrated experience of cloud networking fundaments that are crucial to supporting infrastructure operations and platform tasks. 

Businesses traditionally had to build their own physical networks with servers, physical cables routers, and other connections. Cloud networking changed this by creating a shared network in which AWS owns the responsibility of managing the physical hardware, and users of this can access networking resources virtually through software.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

This repo will have 9 different sections of netwoking concepts, from building our VPC to configuring traffic flow, creating subnets, launching and testing VPC resources, and exploring different connection methods. 

### What are networks?

When defining data transfer in network processes, the data is split into multiple packets that travel through the network and get reassembled once they reached their destination. 

Every device on your network has its own unique IP address in order to receive that data. The network traffic itself has to be maintained such that data is transferred reliably and quickly while preventing malicious traffic and potential crashes. 

### What is a VPC?

A VPC is your own delegated section of the AWS Cloud where you can define the networking rules associated with your account. Specify who can access your application, how applications access the internet, how different services communicate with each other, and how traffic flows between different parts of the system.
